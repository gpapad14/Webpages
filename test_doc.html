<h2> Preface </h2>
</a>

General relativity is the most beautiful physical theory ever invented. It describes
one of the most pervasive features of the world we experience—gravitation—in
terms of an elegant mathematical structure—the differential geometry of curved
spacetime—leading to unambiguous predictions that have received spectacular
experimental confirmation. Consequences of general relativity, from the big bang
to black holes, often get young people first interested in physics, and it is an 
unalloyed joy to finally reach the point in one's studies where these phenomena may
be understood at a rigorous quantitative level. If you are contemplating reading
this book, that point is here.
In recent decades, general relativity (GR) has become an integral and 
indispensable part of modern physics. For a long time after it was proposed by Einstein
in 1916, GR was counted as a shining achievement that lay somewhat outside the
mainstream of interesting research. Increasingly, however, contemporary students
in a variety of specialties are finding it necessary to study Einstein's theory. In 
addition to being an active research area in its own right, GR is part of the standard
syllabus for anyone interested in astrophysics, cosmology, string theory, and even
particle physics. This is not to slight the more pragmatic uses of GR, including
the workings of the Global Positioning System (GPS) satellite network.
There is no shortage of books on GR, and many of them are excellent. Indeed,
approximately thirty years ago witnessed the appearance of no fewer than three
books in the subject, each of which has become a classic in its own right: those by
Weinberg (1972), Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler (1973), and Hawking and Ellis
(1975). Each of these books is suffused with a strongly-held point of view 
advocated by the authors. This has led to a love-hate relationship between these works
and their readers; in each case, it takes little effort to find students who will 
declare them to be the best textbook ever written, or other students who find them
completely unpalatable. For the individuals in question, these judgments may very
well be correct; there are many different ways to approach this subject.
The present book has a single purpose: to provide a clear introduction to 
general relativity, suitable for graduate students or advanced undergraduates. I have
attempted to include enough material so that almost any one-semester 
introductory course on GR can find the appropriate subjects covered in the text, but not
too much more than that. In particular, I have tried to resist the temptation to write
a comprehensive reference book. The only goal of this book is to teach you GR.
An intentional effort has been made to prefer the conventional over the 
idiosyncratic. If I can be accused of any particular ideological bias, it would be a

tendency to think of general relativity as a field theory, a point of view that helps
one to appreciate the connections among GR, particle physics, and string theory.
At the same time, there are a number of exciting astrophysical applications of GR
(black holes, gravitational lensing, the production and detection of gravitational
waves, the early universe, the late universe, the cosmological constant), and I
have endeavored to include at least enough background discussion of these issues
to prepare students to tackle the current literature.
The primary question facing any introductory treatment of general relativity is
the level of mathematical rigor at which to operate. There is no uniquely proper
solution, as different students will respond with different levels of understanding
and enthusiasm to different approaches. Recognizing this, I have tried to 
provide something for everyone. I have not shied away from detailed formalism, but
have also attempted to include concrete examples and informal discussion of the
concepts under consideration. Much of the most mathematical material has been
relegated to the Appendices. Some of the material in the Appendices is actually an
integral part of the course (for example, the discussion of conformal diagrams),
but an individual reader or instructor can decide just when it is appropriate to
delve into them; signposts are included in the body of the text.
Surprisingly, there are very few formal prerequisites for learning general 
relativity; most of the material is developed as we go along. Certainly no prior 
exposure to Riemannian geometry is assumed, nor would it necessarily be helpful.
It would be nice to have already studied some special relativity; although a 
discussion is included in Chapter 1, its purpose is more to review the basics and and
introduce some notation, rather than to provide a self-contained introduction. 
Beyond that, some exposure to electromagnetism, Lagrangian mechanics, and linear
algebra might be useful, but the essentials are included here.
The structure of the book should be clear. The first chapter is a review of 
special relativity and basic tensor algebra, including a brief discussion of classical
field theory. The next two chapters introduce manifolds and curvature in some
detail; some motivational physics is included, but building a mathematical 
framework is the primary goal. General relativity proper is introduced in Chapter 4,
along with some discussion of alternative theories. The next four chapters 
discuss the three major applications of GR: black holes (two chapters), perturbation
theory and gravitational waves, and cosmology. Each of these subjects has 
witnessed an explosion of research in recent years, so the discussions here will be
necessarily introductory, but I have tried to emphasize issues of relevance to 
current work. These three applications can be covered in any order, although there
are interdependencies highlighted in the text. Discussions of experimental tests
are sprinkled through these chapters. Chapter 9 is a brief introduction to 
quantum field theory in curved spacetime; this is not a necessary part of a first look
at GR, but has become increasingly important to work in quantum gravity and
cosmology, and therefore deserves some mention. On the other hand, a few topics
are scandalously neglected; the initial-value problem and cosmological 
perturbation theory come to mind, but there are others. Fortunately there is no shortage of
other resources. The Appendices serve various purposes: There are discussions of

<h2> Special Relativity and Flat Spacetime </h2>
</a>

General relativity (GR) is Einstein's theory of space, time, and gravitation. At
heart it is a very simple subject (compared, for example, to anything involving
quantum mechanics). The essential idea is perfectly straightforward: while most
forces of nature are represented by fields defined on spacetime (such as the 
electromagnetic field, or the short-range fields characteristic of subnuclear forces),
gravity is inherent in spacetime itself. In particular, what we experience as 
"gravity" is a manifestation of the curvature of spacetime.
Our task, then, is clear. We need to understand spacetime, we need to 
understand curvature, and we need to understand how curvature becomes gravity.
Roughly, the first two chapters of this book are devoted to an exploration of space-
time, the third is about curvature, and the fourth explains the relationship between
curvature and gravity, before we get into applications of the theory. However, let's
indulge ourselves with a short preview of what is to come, which will perhaps 
motivate the initial steps of our journey.
GR is a theory of gravity, so we can begin by remembering our previous theory
of gravity, that of Newton. There are two basic elements: an equation for the
gravitational field as influenced by matter, and an equation for the response of
matter to this field. The conventional Newtonian statement of these rules is in
terms of forces between particles; the force between two objects of masses M and
m separated by a vector r = re(r) is the famous inverse-square law,
GMm
F=—2-e(r), (1.1)
and this force acts on a particle of mass m to give it an acceleration according to
Newton's second law,
F = ma. (1.2)
Equivalently, we could use the language of the gravitational potential O; the 
potential is related to the mass density p by Poisson's equation,
V20 = 4ttG/), (1.3)
and the acceleration is given by the gradient of the potential,
a = VO. (1.4)
1Chapter 1 Special Relativity and Flat Spacetime
Either (1.1) and (1.2), or (1.3) and (1.4), serve to define Newtonian gravity. To
define GR, we need to replace each of them by statements about the curvature of
spacetime.
The hard part is the equation governing the response of spacetime curvature to
the presence of matter and energy. We will eventually find what we want in the
form of Einstein's equation,

4.1 PHYSICS IN CURVED SPACETIME
Having paid our mathematical dues, we are now prepared to examine the physics
of gravitation as described by general relativity. This subject falls naturally into
two pieces: how the gravitational field influences the behavior of matter, and how
matter determines the gravitational field. In Newtonian gravity, these two 
elements consist of the expression for the acceleration of a body in a gravitational
potential O,
a=-V4>, (4.1)
and Poisson's differential equation for the potential in terms of the matter density
p and Newton's gravitational constant G:
V20 = 47tGp. (4.2)
In general relativity, the analogous statements will describe how the curvature
of spacetime acts on matter to manifest itself as gravity, and how energy and
momentum influence spacetime to create curvature. In either case it would be
legitimate to start at the top, by stating outright the laws governing physics in
curved spacetime and working out their consequences. Instead, we will try to be
a little more motivational, starting with basic physical principles and attempting
to argue that these lead naturally to an almost unique physical theory.
In Chapter 2 we motivated our discussion of manifolds by introducing the 
Einstein Equivalence Principle, or EEP: "In small enough regions of spacetime, the
laws of physics reduce to those of special relativity; it is impossible to detect the
existence of a gravitational field by means of local experiments." The EEP arises
from the idea that gravity is universal; it affects all particles (and indeed all forms
of energy-momentum) in the same way. This feature of universality led Einstein
to propose that what we experience as gravity is a manifestation of the curvature
of spacetime. The idea is simply that something so universal as gravitation could
be most easily described as a fundamental feature of the background on which
matter fields propagate, as opposed to as a conventional force. At the same time,
the identification of spacetime as a curved manifold is supported by the 
similarity between the undetectability of gravity in local regions and our ability to find
locally inertial coordinates (gp,$ = rj^, d^gjXv = 0 at a point p) on a manifold.

Chapter 4 Gravitation
Best of all, this abstract philosophizing translates directly into a simple recipe
for generalizing laws of physics to the curved-spacetime context, known as the
minimal-coupling principle. In its baldest form, this recipe may be stated as
follows:
1. Take a law of physics, valid in inertial coordinates in flat spacetime.
2. Write it in a coordinate-invariant (tensorial) form.
3. Assert that the resulting law remains true in curved spacetime.
It may seem somewhat melodramatic to take such a simple idea and spread it
out into a three-part procedure. We hope only to make clear that there is nothing
very complicated going on. Operationally, this recipe usually amounts to taking
an agreed-upon law in flat space and replacing the Minkowski metric r)jJiV by
the more general metric gjJiV, and replacing partial derivatives 3M by covariant
derivatives VM. For this reason, this recipe is sometimes known as the "Comma-
Goes-to-Semicolon Rule," by those who use commas and semicolons to denote
partial and covariant derivatives.
As a straightforward example, we can consider the motion of freely-falling
(unaccelerated) particles. In flat space such particles move in straight lines; in
equations, this is expressed as the vanishing of the second derivative of the 
parameterized path x^(k):
