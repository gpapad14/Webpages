# Webpage design with HTML - Choice course SEMFE 2018

In this folder there are the most complete web pages I created during the choice course "New Technologies in Education". "Form.html" file is a webpage where you can fill a form. "test.html" is based on all "test_XXX.html" files and it is a webpage about Physics, the plan of the course, there is a quiz someone can play etc. No prepared code was used. A few images are necessary in order to load the exact design of the page.
